# Hi and Welcome!

* Designs from the Internet: Both websites drew inspiration from designs discovered online, characterized by their appealing layouts and aesthetic elements.
* Code Implementation: My approach involved studying the internet-sourced designs closely and meticulously hand-coding HTML and CSS to replicate every detail. The goal was to faithfully recreate the original visual concept in a web-based environment.
* Tailwind CSS Integration: The efficient Tailwind CSS framework played a pivotal role in streamlining the styling process. It enabled me to maintain clean, organized code while providing responsiveness and reducing redundancy.
